# # Hi there 👋

I'm Eduardo Pna, a passionate **Full-Stack Developer** specializing in:
- 🌐 **Backend Development** with **Python (FastAPI)** and **Node.js**  
- 🛠️ **DevOps** practices, including **CI/CD** pipelines, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Cloud Platforms**  
- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity** and **DevSecOps** to build secure systems and applications
- 🚀 Building **Scalable and Secure APIs** and automating deployment workflows

## 💼 What I Do
I develop and maintain **high-performance APIs** using **FastAPI** (Python) and **Node.js**, focusing on scalability, security, and performance. I also manage end-to-end **DevOps pipelines**, automate deployments with **Docker** and **Kubernetes**, and ensure cloud infrastructure is optimized using **AWS** and **GCP**.

Additionally, I integrate **security practices** into the development lifecycle (DevSecOps) to ensure that applications are built with security in mind from the start.

## 🎯 Goals
As a proponent of **Software Craftsmanship**, I strive to continuously improve my skills and craft, focusing on delivering clean, maintainable, and high-quality software. Here are my current goals:
- **Optimize API Architecture**: I aim to design and implement **robust, maintainable** APIs that are easy to extend and adapt to evolving requirements. My focus is on creating flexible, secure, and scalable systems.
- **Master Serverless Frameworks**: I am actively learning about **serverless computing**, emphasizing clean, modular, and reusable code to create efficient, scalable, and cost-effective solutions for cloud-native applications.
- **Improve Cybersecurity Practices**: I'm dedicated to refining my skills in **secure coding**, **vulnerability assessment**, and applying **best practices** to build software that is not only functional but also secure, robust, and resilient to attacks.
